I built a dashboard to track and visualize the difference between the target set for company ABC and the actual profit realized.

This Dashboard contains:

1. A calendar which can be used to track the target vs realized, both as values and percentage realized from total target. This area of the dashboard can display data for any custom range of days, for either 1 month or multiple cumulated months.

2. A chart that displays the total target vs realized year to date.

3. A KPI card that calculates the percentage realized from the annual total target.

4. A calculation that indicates the amount needed to be made each month, for the remaining months, which cumulated with the current profit Realized, is enough to hit the Target.

6. A chart showing the target vs realized situation, per month, year to date. The blue bars represent the Realized and the orange line represents the Target.
